        <p>Hey its me the creator of server.js, as you may have noticed server.js has been shutdown for quite some time now. The purpose for that was so we could try and get better games to accept it. Not many games have been added, Roblox isn't going to work in this update but maybe it will work one day.</p>
        <p>Anyways, please use our service responsibly</p>
